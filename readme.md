# Hackathon project

Take client's request and proceed it through caching gate.
Cache consists of pdf files that are used to give information context 
for ChatGPT and then introduce client's request to it.

Use mongo to keep files with tags. 
Database "files" should be created manually.
Files uploading mechanism is not finished, 
you should add text and tags right into new document in collection "files"."ClusterizedText"
